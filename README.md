My minimalist website with both a light and dark theme!  
Uses no javascript and very little CSS while continuing to keep the look clean and minimal.

## Light/Dark Theme
The website uses the `prefers-color-scheme` CSS media feature to switch between light and dark theme. This tag is set based on the OS/device theme or system display settings.
