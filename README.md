My minimalist website with both a light and dark theme!  
Uses no javascript currently and as little CSS as possible while keeping the look clean.

## Light/Dark Theme
I use the `prefers-color-scheme` CSS media feature to check whether the user will prefer a light or dark theme. This is supported on almost all major internet browsers (except IE). This tag is set based on the OS/device theme or system display settings.
